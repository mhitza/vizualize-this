# Visualize this

This is an experiment for writing an audio visualizer in Haskell.

# Compilation

To run these commands you first must have installed [cabal-dev][1]:

    cabal-dev install
    ./cabal-dev/bin/vizualize-this

And that should be it. You will need an internet connection to download the dependencies
and the second command of those two should do the trick. Please note that you can install
cabal-dev by doing a usual 'cabal install cabal-dev'.
